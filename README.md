# Intro to React

## Learning Goals:

- What is React?
- Imperative vs Declarative Programming
- Installing and Importing NPM Packages
- Modifying package.json
- React Boilerplate
- Components
- Importing Files
- Props

## Getting Started

Begin by installing the react packages:

```
npm install react react-scripts react-dom
```

This will install 3 packages for us (react, react-scripts, and react-dom).

You can then attempt to run the development server with:

```
npm start
```
